            Kids Are Growing Up Without Essential Life Skills
          </h2>

                  Much of what children learn today is directed by others.
                  School assignments are provided by teachers. Extracurricular
                  activities are often selected by parents and guided by
                  coaches. And in some cases, even personal hobbies are chosen
                  by parents who want to relive their passions or feel their
                  kids will fall behind if they don’t participate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The result is that children spend their formative years in
                  highly structured environments, being told what to do and how
                  to do it. While this helps children reach educational
                  milestones faster — it also teaches kids that success in life
                  is tied to their ability to listen carefully, follow
                  instructions, and complete tasks assigned by others. After
                  all, those are the actions that tend to be praised by parents
                  and teachers alike.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Meanwhile, in the real world, the adults who live the most
                  rewarding lives are those who take the initiative, make bold
                  choices, and are highly-adaptable when things don’t go
                  according to plan. Rather than simply following instructions
                  or dutifully completing routine tasks — they’re eager to
                  identify new ways to create value or new opportunities worth
                  exploring, and they have the confidence to take action on
                  their own and overcome obstacles along the way.

            We Must Raise Kids To Be Curious Problem Solvers
          </h2>
          <div class="solver_section-description">
            <p>
              Today, the greatest opportunities for personal fulfillment and
              financial success are available to those who are curious,
              independent, and confident. These are the traits that will best
              prepare children to thrive in an increasingly unpredictable world.
              One in which traditionally ‘safe’ and ‘predictable’ career paths
              are now being automated or outsourced away.
            </p>
            <p>
              And, to be clear, the word ‘confidence’ is not referring to the
              false-confidence that a child gets as a result of being sheltered
              from challenges early in life. Instead, it refers to the
              confidence that can only be earned through pursuing difficult
              challenges, experiencing occasional failure, and — when the
              outcome really matters — discovering the power to push through,
              not because a parent or coach insisted, but because the child
              chose to stick with it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The good news is that we don’t have to instill kids with a sense
              of curiosity, a desire to learn, or a willingness to persevere in
              the face of adversity. Fortunately, a child’s sense of curiosity
              and desire to learn begins almost immediately after birth. In
              fact, infants and toddlers are so curious they often get
              themselves into trouble and are willing to push through boundaries
              set by their parents — even at the risk of facing punishment or
              consequences.
            </p>
            <p>
              The problem today is that kids have fewer opportunities to
              exercise their curiosity, explore their own interests, and pursue
              self-selected goals. Dinner Time University explains how, as
              parents, we can support our children in becoming more independent
              and confident without over-parenting or disrupting their sense of
              autonomy. It’s a practical and actionable guide for raising
              confident problem solvers who are excited to tackle the
              opportunities of the future.

                    Rick Kettner dropped out of highschool to pursue life as an
                    entrepreneur during the ‘dot com boom’ of the late 1990s.
                    While his early startup ideas found limited success — he
                    persisted and went on to co-found three highly successful
                    businesses in online music education, including Drumeo,
                    Pianote, and Guitareo.

                    Now a father of three young children, he has become obsessed
                    with understanding how parents can best prepare their kids
                    to thrive in an increasingly unpredictable world. This has
                    led him to not only reflect on the merits of his own unusual
                    upbringing, but to also study the latest expert advice to
                    gain a deeper understanding of how to best nurture critical
                    life skills.

                    mentorship. The book covers nine key insights for helping
                    children acquire the skills, experience, and confidence

                    There are countless books, articles, and podcasts offering
                    up useful parenting advice. Unfortunately, the overwhelming
                    majority focus on what to do and sometimes why to do it,
                    but what is often missing is a clear sense of how, when, and
                    where to fit the insights into everyday life.

                    This book is different. It’s geared toward creating
                    meaningful and lasting change. Rather than just leaving you
                    with a collection of helpful tips — the insights are built
                    around a simple daily ritual that makes it easy to guide
                    your children’s development in a practical and actionable
                    way.
